AdWords template

Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file with common AdWords display ad sizes.
1. Fill in with your favorite artwork. 
2. Export to screens.
3. Save Artboards to Files. - Each artboard will save out as an individual file and you can upload those to adwords.


Icon Creator

Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file with common icon and logo sizes.
1. Go to symbols window and edit the symbol inside. 
2. Replace the artwork in the symbol with your artwork. Copy/Paste if your artwork is already in .ai.
  a. You will want to center your artwork and make your artwork about the same size as mine. That way it will fit better.
3. Each box should now have artwork in it.
4. You may need to adjust the size of individual pieces. Just change the size, do not edit the symbol or you will change all instances.
5. Now go to File > Export to Screens > Artboards to Files.
6. Done.
